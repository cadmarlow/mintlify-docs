# Workspace Setup

Your workspace is the central hub for your team. Configure it properly to get the most out of tldr.work.

---

## What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** is your organization's container in tldr.work. It includes:

- All prospects and campaigns
- AI monitoring projects
- Team members (coming soon)
- Billing and usage data
- API key configuration
- Settings and preferences

<Info>
One workspace = one billing account. Create separate workspaces for different businesses/clients (coming soon).
</Info>

---

## Accessing Workspace Settings

Go to **Settings** (sidebar) > **Workspace**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workspace-settings.png" alt="Workspace settings page" />
</Frame>

---

## Basic Settings

### Workspace Name

**What it is**: Display name for your workspace (e.g., "Acme Inc", "John's Agency")

**Where it appears**:
- Dashboard header
- Email sender name (if not customized)
- Billing invoices

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  Your company or personal brand name
</ParamField>

**Example**: Change from default "User's Workspace" to "Acme Marketing"

---

## Email Settings

Configure how your campaigns appear to recipients.

### From Name

<ParamField path="fromName" type="string">
  **Sender name in emails**
  
  Default: Your account name. Customize for better personalization.
</ParamField>

**Examples**:
- "John from Acme" (personal touch)
- "Acme Sales Team" (company brand)
- "Marie - Marketing Expert" (personal brand)

<Tip>
Personal names ("John") get **30% better open rates** than company names ("Acme Inc").
</Tip>

### From Email

<ParamField path="fromEmail" type="string">
  **Sender email address**
  
  Must be verified with Resend. Default: your account email.
</ParamField>

**Requirements**:
- Must be a real email you own
- Will receive replies from prospects
- Should match your domain for best deliverability

<Warning>
Using a different email than your signup email requires verification. Check your inbox for verification email.
</Warning>

---

## Campaign Settings

### Daily Email Limit

<ParamField path="dailyEmailLimit" type="number" default={50}>
  **Maximum emails sent per day**
  
  Range: 10-500. Default: 50 emails/day.
</ParamField>

**Why limit emails?**
- Prevents spam filters from flagging your domain
- Maintains sender reputation
- Gradual warm-up for new accounts

**Recommendations**:

| Account Age | Recommended Limit |
|-------------|-------------------|
| New (< 1 week) | 20-30/day |
| Medium (1-4 weeks) | 50-100/day |
| Established (> 1 month) | 100-200/day |
| Warm domain (> 6 months) | 200-500/day |

<Info>
Start low and increase gradually. Sudden spikes trigger spam filters!
</Info>

### Tracking Enabled

<ParamField path="trackingEnabled" type="boolean" default={true}>
  **Enable open and click tracking**
  
  Tracks when recipients open emails and click links.
</ParamField>

**How it works**:
- **Opens**: 1x1 pixel image loaded when email opened
- **Clicks**: Links rewritten to track clicks before redirecting

**Privacy note**: Some email clients block tracking pixels. Real open rate is typically 10-20% higher than tracked.

<Tip>
Disable tracking for personal/sensitive campaigns to avoid seeming "salesy".
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Email Settings
- ✅ Use your real name for personal outreach
- ✅ Use company name for brand awareness campaigns
- ✅ Match sender email to your domain (john@acme.com, not gmail.com)
- ❌ Don't use no-reply@ addresses (kills engagement)

### Daily Limits
- ✅ Start low (20-30/day) for new accounts
- ✅ Increase gradually (10-20% per week)
- ✅ Monitor bounce rate (should be < 5%)
- ❌ Don't send 500 emails on day 1 (instant spam flag)

### API Keys
- ✅ Add your own keys if sending > 100 emails/week
- ✅ Use dedicated API accounts (don't share with other tools)
- ✅ Monitor API usage in each service's dashboard
- ❌ Don't share API keys with others (security risk)

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do I need to verify my email?">
    Email verification ensures:
    - **Security**: Prevents fake accounts
    - **Email deliverability**: Confirms you own the email (important for campaigns)
    - **Account recovery**: Allows password resets
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use a personal email (Gmail, Yahoo)?">
    Yes, but we recommend work emails because:
    - Better deliverability for campaigns (less likely to be marked spam)
    - Professional sender name in outreach
    - Easier organization if you have a team
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do free credits expire?">
    Yes, **welcome credits expire after 30 days**. This encourages active usage during trial.
    
    Paid plan credits never expire - they reset monthly based on your plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens after free credits run out?">
    You'll see a notification in your dashboard. You can:
    - **Upgrade to a paid plan** (Starter: €20/mo, Pro: €60/mo, Ultra: €200/mo)
    - **Wait for next billing cycle** if you're on a paid plan
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple accounts?">
    One account per person is recommended. If you need multiple workspaces (e.g., for different clients), use our workspace feature (coming soon) or contact support@tldr.work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete my account?">
    Yes. Go to **Settings** > **Account** > **Delete Account**. This is permanent and cannot be undone.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Email verification link expired

**Solution**: Go back to the login page and use the verification resend option.

### Issue: "Email already exists"

**Solution**: You already have an account. Click "Login" instead or use "Forgot password" to reset.

### Issue: Password too weak

**Solution**: Use at least 8 characters with a mix of:
- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Symbols (!@#$%^&*)

### Issue: Can't log in after verifying

**Solution**: 
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Make sure you're using the email you signed up with
4. Contact support@tldr.work

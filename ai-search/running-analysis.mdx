## What Happens During Analysis

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    tldr->>ChatGPT: Prompt 1
    ChatGPT-->>tldr: Response
    tldr->>Claude: Prompt 1
    Claude-->>tldr: Response
    tldr->>Gemini: Prompt 1
    Gemini-->>tldr: Response
    tldr->>Perplexity: Prompt 1
    Perplexity-->>tldr: Response
    tldr->>Mistral: Prompt 1
    Mistral-->>tldr: Response
    Note over tldr: Repeat for prompts 2-10
```

For each prompt:
1. Sent to all 5 engines simultaneously
2. Each engine generates response
3. GPT-5 analyzes each response:
   - Is your brand mentioned?
   - Where does it rank?
   - What's the sentiment?
   - Which competitors mentioned?

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Analysis taking too long">
    **Normal**: 5-10 minutes for 50 queries
    
    **If > 15 minutes**:
    - Check progress bar (might be stuck)
    - Refresh page
    - Contact support if stuck
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Some engines failed">
    **Possible reasons**:
    - Engine temporarily down
    - Rate limit hit
    - Insufficient OpenRouter credits
    
    **Solution**: Re-run analysis for failed engines only
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="All visibility scores are 0%">
    **Possible reasons**:
    - New/unknown brand
    - No online presence
    - Wrong domain analyzed
    
    **Solution**: Verify domain, add more content, try again in 1 month
  </Accordion>

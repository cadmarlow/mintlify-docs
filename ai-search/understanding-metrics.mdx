# Understanding AI Visibility Metrics

Master the key metrics to track and optimize your AI presence.

---

## Core Metrics

### 1. Visibility Score

**What it is**: % of AI responses that mention your brand

**Formula**: `(Mentions / Total Responses) × 100`

**Example**:
- 10 prompts × 5 engines = 50 total responses
- Your brand mentioned in 20 responses
- **Visibility = 40%**

**Benchmarks**:

| Prompt Category | Good | Great | Excellent |
|----------------|------|-------|-----------|
| Brand | 80-90% | 90-95% | 95-100% |
| Product | 60-80% | 80-90% | 90-100% |
| Competitor | 30-40% | 40-60% | > 60% |
| Intent | 10-20% | 20-30% | > 30% |

<Info>
Intent visibility > 20% means AI recommends you organically - EXCELLENT!
</Info>

### 2. Average Position

**What it is**: Where you rank when mentioned (#1-10)

**Formula**: `Sum of positions / Number of mentions`

**Example**:
- ChatGPT lists you #3
- Claude lists you #1
- Gemini doesn't mention you
- **Avg Position = (3 + 1) / 2 = #2.0**

**Benchmarks**:

| Position | Rating | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **#1-2** | Excellent ✅ | Maintain |
| **#3-5** | Good ⚠️ | Optimize |
| **> #5** | Poor ❌ | Urgent fix |

<Tip>
Position #1-3 get 80% of user attention. Optimize to rank higher!
</Tip>

### 3. Sentiment

**What it is**: How positively AI talks about you

**Categories**:
- **Positive**: "Best", "Recommended", "Excellent", "Leading"
- **Neutral**: Factual description, no opinion
- **Negative**: "However", "Limited", "Issues", "Not recommended"

**Example sentiment analysis**:

ChatGPT says: "Acme is an **affordable** CRM **ideal for** startups."
- **Sentiment**: Positive ("affordable", "ideal for")

Claude says: "Acme offers basic features **but lacks** advanced analytics."
- **Sentiment**: Negative ("but lacks")

**Benchmarks**:
- **Good**: > 60% positive
- **Great**: > 80% positive
- **Excellent**: > 90% positive

### 4. Mentions

**What it is**: Raw count of times your brand appeared

**Formula**: Count across all responses

**Example**:
- 10 prompts × 5 engines = 50 responses
- Brand mentioned 20 times
- **Mentions = 20**

# Billing Plans

tldr.work uses a simple model:

- You choose a monthly plan.
- Each plan gives you a **monthly credit budget** in EUR.
- Every billable action (AI search, enrichment, email generation, sending, etc.) deducts from that budget.

## Current Plans

| Plan | Price / month | Included credit budget | Best for |
|------|----------------|------------------------|----------|
| Starter | €20 | €20 credits | Individuals and small teams |
| Pro | €60 | €60 credits | Growing teams with regular usage |
| Ultra | €200 | €200 credits | High-volume teams and agencies |

<Note>
New accounts start with **€15 free credits** for the first month so you can test the platform before upgrading.
</Note>

## What Is Included?

All paid plans include access to the same core product features:

- Sales automation (prospecting, enrichment, campaign workflows)
- AI generation features
- Brand Monitor / AI Search analytics
- Billing dashboard and usage logs

The main difference between plans is your **monthly credit budget**.

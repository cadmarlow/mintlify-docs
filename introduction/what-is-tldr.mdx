# What is tldr.work?

tldr.work is **the operating system for your business** - an all-in-one platform that combines AI-powered sales automation with brand monitoring across AI engines like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

## The Problem We Solve

Modern businesses face two critical challenges:

### Challenge 1: Sales is Time-Consuming

- Finding qualified prospects takes hours
- Writing personalized emails is repetitive
- Tracking campaigns requires constant monitoring
- Scaling outreach means hiring more people

### Challenge 2: AI is Changing Discovery

- 60% of searches now happen on AI assistants (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)
- Traditional SEO doesn't work for AI engines
- You have no idea if AI recommends your brand
- Competitors might be ranking higher than you

## The tldr.work Solution

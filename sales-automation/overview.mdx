## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Define Your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)" icon="bullseye">
    Before searching, know:
    - **Industry**: SaaS, e-commerce, healthcare, etc.
    - **Company size**: Employees, revenue range
    - **Location**: Geography matters (timezone, language, regulations)
    - **Tech stack**: What tools do they use?
    - **Pain points**: What problems can you solve?
    
    **Good query**: "B2B SaaS companies in Europe, 50-200 employees, using Salesforce"  
    **Bad query**: "Companies that might need marketing help"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Verify Before Sending" icon="circle-check">
    Always check:
    - Email verification score (>90 recommended)
    - Company website is active
    - Contact role matches your target (don't email interns for CEO-level deals)
    - No duplicate contacts (same person at different companies)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Personalize Beyond Name" icon="user">
    AI personalizes based on:
    - Company industry and size
    - Recipient role and seniority
    - Location and market
    - Recent news or funding
    
    **Example**: "Saw Acme just raised $10M - congrats! As you scale from 20 to 100 people, outbound sales will get harder. We help Series A companies automate prospecting..."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Test and Iterate" icon="flask">
    A/B test:
    - Subject lines (short vs long, question vs statement)
    - Email length (50 words vs 200 words)
    - Tone (professional vs casual)
    - CTA (meeting request vs demo offer vs free trial)
    
    **Track**: Which variant gets more opens? Clicks? Replies?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Follow Up (But Don't Spam)" icon="reply">
    Best practices:
    - **1st follow-up**: After 3 days (if no reply)
    - **2nd follow-up**: After 1 week (if still no reply)
    - **Stop after 3 emails**: Don't be annoying
    - **Add value**: Each follow-up should offer something new (case study, blog post, discount)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Don't send 500 emails on day 1**  
Gradual warm-up prevents spam filters. Start with 20-30/day, increase by 10-20% weekly.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Don't use generic templates**  
"Hi [Name], I hope this email finds you well..." = instant delete. Be specific and relevant.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Don't ignore bounce rate**  
>5% bounce rate = your domain reputation drops. Clean your list regularly.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Don't buy email lists**  
Purchased lists have terrible deliverability and damage your sender reputation. Always build your own.
</Warning>

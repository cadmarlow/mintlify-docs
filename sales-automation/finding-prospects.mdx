## Search Query Best Practices

### ✅ Good Queries

<CodeGroup>
```text Example 1: Specific Industry + Location
"Software companies in Berlin"
```

```text Example 2: Industry + Size + Location
"Marketing agencies in France with 10-50 employees"
```

```text Example 3: Niche + Geography
"Organic food stores in California"
```

```text Example 4: Industry + Tech Stack
"SaaS companies using Salesforce"
```
</CodeGroup>

### ❌ Bad Queries

<CodeGroup>
```text Too Vague
"Companies"
→ Too broad, will return random results
```

```text Too Specific
"Companies selling blue widgets to Fortune 500 CEOs"
→ Too niche, might return 0 results
```

```text Wrong Format
"company_type:SaaS location:Paris"
→ Use natural language, not code syntax
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No results found">
    **Possible reasons**:
    - Query too specific (try broader search)
    - Location not recognized (try "France" instead of "Île-de-France")
    - Industry doesn't exist (try "software" instead of "SaaS blockchain")
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Remove one filter at a time
    - Try synonyms ("marketing agencies" vs "digital agencies")
    - Increase max results (10 → 50)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Results not relevant">
    **Possible reasons**:
    - Query too vague ("companies" vs "SaaS companies")
    - Mixed criteria ("restaurants and law firms")
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Be more specific
    - One industry per search
    - Use location filters
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search taking too long">
    **Normal behavior**: 20-40 seconds is typical
    
    **If > 2 minutes**:
    - Check internet connection
    - Try reducing max results (100 → 50)
    - Contact support if persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate prospects">
    **Why it happens**: Same company appears in multiple searches
    
    **Solutions**:
    - tldr.work auto-deduplicates by domain
    - Manual: Delete duplicates from prospect list
    - Future searches won't add existing prospects
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

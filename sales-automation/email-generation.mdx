## Email Examples

### Example 1: B2B SaaS (Short + Professional)

**Goal**: Book a demo  
**Recipient**: Sarah Chen, Head of Sales at 50-person SaaS company

```
Subject: Quick question about Acme's sales process

Hi Sarah,

I noticed Acme recently hit 50 employees - congrats on the growth!

As you scale, outbound prospecting typically becomes a bottleneck. We help SaaS sales teams like yours automate lead discovery and email outreach (saves ~20h/week).

Worth a 15-min demo this week?

Best,
John
```

**Why it works**:
- Personal opening (company milestone)
- Clear value prop (saves time)
- Simple CTA (15-min demo)

---

### Example 2: Local Business (Casual + Short)

**Goal**: Schedule consultation  
**Recipient**: Marie Dubois, Owner of bakery in Lyon

```
Subject: Help your bakery reach more Lyon customers

Bonjour Marie,

Love what you're doing at La Pâtisserie Lyonnaise! 🥐

Quick question - are you happy with how many locals find you online? Most bakeries in Lyon miss 60% of potential customers because they're not optimized for Google/Instagram.

We specialize in helping local food businesses get discovered. Free 20-min consultation this week?

À bientôt,
Sophie
```

**Why it works**:
- Local references (Lyon, French greeting)
- Specific pain point (local discovery)
- Casual, friendly tone

---

### Example 3: Agency (Medium + Friendly)

**Goal**: Partnership proposal  
**Recipient**: Tom Wilson, Founder of marketing agency

```
Subject: Partnering on AI-powered outreach for your clients

Hey Tom,

Saw that Wilson & Co specializes in B2B marketing for SaaS companies. Impressive client roster!

We're building partnerships with agencies like yours to offer AI-powered prospecting as an add-on service. It's basically "done-for-you" lead generation that your clients love (and it's recurring revenue for you).

Quick example: One of our agency partners added $50k/year by offering this to 10 clients at $400/month each.

Would you be open to a quick call to explore if this makes sense for Wilson & Co?

Cheers,
Alex
```

**Why it works**:
- Acknowledges their expertise
- Clear partnership value
- Concrete revenue example

## Optimizing Generated Emails

### Improve Subject Lines

GPT-5's subjects are good, but you can improve:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Original">
    "Introduction to tldr.work"
    
    ❌ Generic, no curiosity
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Improved">
    "Quick question about Acme's sales process"
    
    ✅ Personal, creates curiosity
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Subject line best practices**:
- Keep under 50 characters
- Include prospect's company name
- Ask a question (creates curiosity)
- Avoid spam words (FREE, ACT NOW, LIMITED TIME)

### Improve Opening Lines

**Bad openings** (delete these):
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "My name is John and I work at..."
- "I wanted to reach out because..."

**Good openings**:
- "Saw that Acme just raised $10M - congrats!"
- "Quick question about your sales process"
- "Love what you're doing at [Company]"

### Improve CTAs

**Weak CTAs**:
- "Let me know if you're interested"
- "Feel free to reach out"
- "Would love to connect"

**Strong CTAs**:
- "Worth a 15-min call this week?"
- "Open to a quick demo on Tuesday?"
- "Can I send you a one-pager?"

### Length Guidelines

| Length | Words | Best For |

| **Short** | 50-100 | Cold outreach, first touch |
| **Medium** | 150-200 | Warm leads, follow-ups |
| **Long** | 250-300 | Complex products, warm introductions |

<Warning>
Longer ≠ better. Short emails get 50% more replies in cold outreach!
</Warning>

## Advanced Tips

### A/B Testing

Generate 2-3 versions for testing:
1. Generate email with "Short + Casual"
2. Regenerate with "Medium + Professional"
3. Send both to different segments
4. Track which performs better

### Context Examples

Add context to improve personalization:

<CodeGroup>
```text Promotion
"Mention our 50% off deal for new customers"
```

```text Social Proof
"We've worked with 50+ SaaS companies like Slack, Notion"
```

```text Urgency
"We're only taking 10 new clients this quarter"
```

```text Recent News
"Reference their Series A funding announced last week"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Industry-Specific Templates

Tell GPT-5 your industry experience:

```
Context: "We specialize in helping e-commerce stores reduce cart abandonment. Mention our Shopify integration and 30% average improvement in conversion rate."
```

Result: Email will reference e-commerce challenges and your solution's specifics.

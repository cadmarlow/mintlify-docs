## Email Variables

Personalize emails with variables:

| Variable | Replaced With | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `{{firstName}}` | Recipient first name | "John" |
| `{{lastName}}` | Recipient last name | "Doe" |
| `{{company}}` | Company name | "Acme Inc" |
| `{{website}}` | Company website | "acme.com" |
| `{{industry}}` | Industry | "B2B SaaS" |
| `{{location}}` | Location | "Paris, France" |

**Example email**:
```
Hi {{firstName}},

Saw that {{company}} recently expanded to {{location}}. 
As you grow, outbound sales gets harder...
```

**Sends as**:
```
Hi John,

Saw that Acme Inc recently expanded to Paris, France.
As you grow, outbound sales gets harder...
```

<Tip>
Always use `{{firstName}}` instead of hardcoding names!
</Tip>

## Daily Limits & Scheduling

### Why Limit Daily Sends?

- **Prevents spam filters**: Gradual sending = better reputation
- **Maintains deliverability**: ISPs like consistent volume
- **Warm-up new domains**: Start slow, increase over time

### Recommended Limits

| Account Age | Recommended Limit |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Brand new (< 1 week) | 20-30/day |
| New (1-4 weeks) | 50-100/day |
| Established (1-3 months) | 100-200/day |
| Warm (> 6 months) | 200-500/day |

<Warning>
Never jump from 50/day to 500/day! Increase gradually (10-20% per week).
</Warning>

## Campaign Status

## Managing Campaigns

### Pause Campaign

Click **"Pause"** to temporarily stop sending. Resume anytime.

**Use cases**:
- Need to update email template
- Too many replies to handle
- Bounce rate too high (> 5%)

### Stop Campaign

Click **"Stop"** to permanently end campaign. Can't resume.

**Use cases**:
- Campaign underperforming
- Wrong target audience
- Product/service changed

### View Recipients

Click **"Recipients"** to see:
- Who received email (with timestamp)
- Who opened (with timestamp)
- Who clicked (with link clicked)
- Who replied

## Best Practices

### Segment Your Campaigns

Don't send one email to everyone:
- **By industry**: SaaS vs E-commerce vs Services
- **By size**: Startups vs SMBs vs Enterprise
- **By location**: US vs Europe vs APAC
- **By role**: CEOs vs Managers vs Individual contributors

### A/B Test

Create 2 campaigns with:
- Different subject lines
- Different email length
- Different CTAs
- Different send times

**Track**: Which gets better opens/clicks/replies?

### Follow-Up Sequences

Create 3 campaigns:
1. **Initial email**: Soft introduction
2. **Follow-up 1** (after 3 days): Add value (case study, blog post)
3. **Follow-up 2** (after 7 days): Final ask

<Tip>
Response rates increase 50% with 2-3 follow-ups!
